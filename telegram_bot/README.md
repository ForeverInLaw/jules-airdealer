# Telegram Ordering System Bot

This project is a Telegram bot designed for managing an ordering system, built with Python using the Aiogram 3.x library and integrated with Supabase for database backend.

## üåü Features

*   User registration and language selection (English, Russian, Polish).
*   Product catalog browsing by categories (manufacturers and search to be implemented).
*   Paginated product lists and detailed product views with images.
*   Shopping cart functionality (view cart, add items - location selection for adding to cart needs refinement).
*   Order creation and viewing user's order history (placeholder).
*   Basic settings management (language change).
*   Supabase integration for all data persistence.
*   Localization support for UI elements.
*   Admin functions (defined in database structure, bot-side implementation pending).
*   Supports both polling and webhook modes for receiving Telegram updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd telegram-bot
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    *   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Edit the `.env` file and fill in your actual credentials and settings:
        *   `BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot token.
        *   `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
        *   `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase public anon key.
        *   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Your Supabase service role key (for admin operations).
        *   `ADMIN_IDS`: Comma-separated Telegram user IDs for bot administrators.
        *   `WEBHOOK_URL` (Optional): If you plan to use webhooks.
        *   `DEBUG` (Optional): Set to `True` for debug logging.

5.  **Set up Supabase Database:**
    *   Ensure your Supabase project is created.
    *   Import the necessary database schema. The required tables include:
        `users`, `locations`, `manufacturers`, `categories`, `products`, `product_localization`, `product_stock`, `orders`, `order_items`, `user_cart`, `interface_text`, `admins`.
    *   Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies as needed. (Refer to the detailed requirements document for examples).
    *   Ensure the `get_categories_with_product_count` RPC function is created in Supabase if you are using the catalog feature as implemented.

## üöÄ Running the Bot

*   **Polling Mode (default):**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

*   **Webhook Mode:**
    Ensure `WEBHOOK_URL` is correctly set in your `.env` file. You will also need a reverse proxy (like Nginx) to forward requests from your public `WEBHOOK_URL` to the bot application.
    ```bash
    python webhook.py
    ```

## üìñ Detailed Documentation

(If this code was generated based on an issue, that issue description serves as the detailed document).

## üìù To-Do / Further Development

*   Implement "Browse by Manufacturers" and "Search" in the catalog.
*   Refine location selection logic, especially for adding items to the cart and during checkout.
*   Complete implementation of cart modification (update quantity, remove item).
*   Full checkout process leading to order creation.
*   Detailed order view for users.
*   Admin panel functionalities (e.g., order management, product management).
*   More robust error handling and user feedback.
*   Comprehensive testing.
